        IUT Computer Society (IUTCS) was formed by the students of the
        department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) (former CIT) of
        Islamic University of Technology (IUT) in 2008. There are mainly three
        societies in IUT and IUTCS is one of them. Students of other departments
        can also join this society. We have an active student body which
        arranges several events like Programming Classes and Contests,
        Application Development Classes, Co-Curricular Aid and Projects etc in a
        regular basis. We also arrange several workshops on different topics
        which are also accompanied by IT professionals of our country. At
        present we have 7 committees to execute these functions. These are:
